# [**OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025**](https://genai.owasp.org/) Mapping to Security Frameworks

Mapping the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Models (LLMs) Applications 2025 to well-established security frameworks is a crucial step in developing secure AI applications. As LLMs become increasingly integrated into sensitive and high-stakes environments, their complex structures introduce unique risks that can be challenging to address with traditional cybersecurity practices alone. We must understand there is not one size fits all and each industry and particular organization requires a customized approach.
