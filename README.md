# 2025LLMTop10Mapping
OWASP Top 10 for LLM Apps 2025 list was mapped to the main cybersecurity frameworks, you will find:

**1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework CFS2.0**
-	Provides comprehensive guidelines for managing cybersecurity risk.
-	A foundational framework for cybersecurity recognized worldwide.

**2. ISO/IEC Standards**
-	ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management)
-	ISO/IEC 20547-4:2020 (Big Data Reference Architecture Security and Privacy)
-	Crucial for global business compliance and establishing security controls.

**3. MITRE ATT&CK**
-	A detailed knowledge base for understanding and defending against cyber attacks.
-	Practical for threat modelling and security analysis.

**4. CIS Controls**
  -	Developed by the Centre for Internet Security, offering actionable controls.
  -	Well-regarded for practicality in strengthening cybersecurity defences.

**5. CVEs and CWEs**
  -	Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)
  -	Common Weakness Enumeration (CWEs)
  -	Essential for identifying and cataloging vulnerabilities.

**6. FAIR**
  -	Factor Analysis of Information Risk focuses on risk quantification and management.
  -	Helps organizations quantify cybersecurity risk in financial terms.

**7. STRIDE**
  -	A threat modelling methodology for identifying security threats.
  -	Often used in the early stages of software development.

**8. ENISA**
  -	The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security provides broad cybersecurity advice.
  -	Relevant especially for compliance and best practices in European contexts.

**9. ASVS**
  -	The Application Security Verification Standard, important for web application security.
  -	Provides a basis for testing and assessing web application security controls.

**10. SAMM**
  -	Software Assurance Maturity Model, useful for integrating security into software development.
  -	Helps in benchmarking and improving software security practices.

**11. MITRE ATLAS**
  -	Focused on adversarial behaviours and may not cover all aspects of cybersecurity management.
  -	Specific and detailed for threat modelling and analysis.

**12. BSIMM**
  -	Building Security In Maturity Model, a tool for measuring and improving software security initiatives.
  -	Best suited for software security practices within organizations.

**13. OPENCRE**
  -	A facilitator for understanding and implementing cybersecurity controls across different standards.
  -	Acts as a bridge between various frameworks rather than a standalone guide.

**14. CycloneDX Machine Learning Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**
  -	Standard that provides advanced supply chain capabilities for cyber risk reduction.
  -	Standard capable of representing software, hardware, services, and other types of inventory.
