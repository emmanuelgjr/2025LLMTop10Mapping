# OWASP Top10 for LLM Applications 2025 Mapping

This mapping is part of the Data Gathering Methodology initiative.
The OWASP Top 10 for LLM Apps 2025 list was mapped to the main cybersecurity frameworks, here you will find:

**1. NIST Cybersecurity Framework CFS2.0**
-	Provides comprehensive guidelines for managing cybersecurity risk.
-	A foundational framework for cybersecurity recognized worldwide.

**2. ISO/IEC Standards**
-	ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management)
-	ISO/IEC 20547-4:2020 (Big Data Reference Architecture Security and Privacy)
-	Crucial for global business compliance and establishing security controls.

**3. MITRE ATT&CK**
-	A detailed knowledge base for understanding and defending against cyber attacks.
-	Practical for threat modelling and security analysis.

**4. CIS Controls**
  -	Developed by the Centre for Internet Security, offering actionable controls.
  -	Well-regarded for practicality in strengthening cybersecurity defences.

**5. CVEs and CWEs**
  -	Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)
  -	Common Weakness Enumeration (CWEs)
  -	Essential for identifying and cataloging vulnerabilities.

**6. FAIR**
  -	Factor Analysis of Information Risk focuses on risk quantification and management.
  -	Helps organizations quantify cybersecurity risk in financial terms.

**7. STRIDE**
  -	A threat modelling methodology for identifying security threats.
  -	Often used in the early stages of software development.

**8. ENISA**
  -	The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security provides broad cybersecurity advice.
  -	Relevant especially for compliance and best practices in European contexts.

**9. ASVS**
  -	The Application Security Verification Standard, important for web application security.
  -	Provides a basis for testing and assessing web application security controls.

**10. SAMM**
  -	Software Assurance Maturity Model, useful for integrating security into software development.
  -	Helps in benchmarking and improving software security practices.

**11. MITRE ATLAS**
  -	Focused on adversarial behaviours and may not cover all aspects of cybersecurity management.
  -	Specific and detailed for threat modelling and analysis.

**12. BSIMM**
  -	Building Security In Maturity Model, a tool for measuring and improving software security initiatives.
  -	Best suited for software security practices within organizations.

**13. OPENCRE**
  -	A facilitator for understanding and implementing cybersecurity controls across different standards.
  -	Acts as a bridge between various frameworks rather than a standalone guide.

**14. CycloneDX Machine Learning Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**
  -	Standard that provides advanced supply chain capabilities for cyber risk reduction.
  -	Standard capable of representing software, hardware, services, and other types of inventory.

## Future Trends

### Emerging LLM Threats
- **AI Model Extraction Attacks:** Attackers may reverse-engineer models by querying them extensively to recreate their structure and training data.
- **Data Memorization Risks:** LLMs might inadvertently memorize and output parts of the training data, leading to privacy breaches.
- **Autonomous Agents and LLMs:** As LLMs are increasingly integrated into autonomous agents, managing the scope of actions and ensuring oversight becomes critical.

### Preparing for Future LLM Risks
- Develop guidelines on securely integrating LLMs into more complex systems, such as autonomous vehicles or decision-making agents.
- Advocate for more research on enhancing model robustness, focusing on differential privacy and secure federated learning techniques.
